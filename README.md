Engaging in a JavaScript project, I've explored a captivating number guessing game. Within the game's framework, you're tasked with pinpointing a number from 1 to 20. Initially, your score starts at 20. Correctly guessing the number elevates your current score to the coveted high score. However, an incorrect guess leads to score deductions. The game incorporates a 'Check' button for confirming guesses and delivers hints for high or low guesses. Moreover, a reset button restores the default interface when clicked. This project is a dynamic way to enhance web development prowess!"
